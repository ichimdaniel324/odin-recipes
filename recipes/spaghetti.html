    <h1>Chef John's Spaghetti al Tonno</h1>
    <img src="../images/spaghetti.png" alt="finished dish"/>
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Spaghetti al tonno is one of my all-time favorite go to pasta dishes. I love a classic meat sauce as much as the next half-italian, but when I want something quick and easy for a weeknight meal, I reach for the tuna.</p>
    <p>What if you don't like fish? Then this is perfect. The taste and texture is really closer to a veal sauce than one made with fish</p>


    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 anchovy fillet</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
